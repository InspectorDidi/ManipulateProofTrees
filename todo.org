* DONE Decide if want to merge library and library proof folders
  I do and I did
* DONE Separate out functionality for other kind of dag,
  Where should I put all of the other functions?
  The first kind of dag should be called dependency graphs
   Make two separate files
  Then can change names within ManipPfTrees.org to be more systematic

* DONE Factor out common functionality between ManipPfTrees.org and GenerateDependencyGraphs.org
  Want tree manip utilities, plot num nodes at depth

* DONE Create DAG for library
* DONE Remove utils from global namespace
* TODO Find compressions in propositional logic
* DONE Load different levels of theorem graphs (with rand and without) into a folder
* TODO Do some Ising stuff on it
  Simon is doing this
* DONE Speed up random graph generation
* TODO Calculate Louvain modularity
  Get diff between real and nulls

Compare mathematica graph to dag to generated
 Got mathematica dependency graph file
 Generate comparable graph
 
 Import dependency graph file
