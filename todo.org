* DONE Decide if want to merge library and library proof folders
  I do and I did
* DONE Separate out functionality for other kind of dag,
  Where should I put all of the other functions?
  The first kind of dag should be called dependency graphs
   Make two separate files
  Then can change names within ManipPfTrees.org to be more systematic

* DONE Factor out common functionality between ManipPfTrees.org and GenerateDependencyGraphs.org
  Want tree manip utilities, plot num nodes at depth

* DONE Create DAG for library
* DONE Remove utils from global namespace
* DONE Load different levels of theorem graphs (with rand and without) into a folder
* DONE some Ising stuff on it
  Simon is doing this
* DONE Speed up random graph generation
* DONE Calculate Louvain modularity
  Get diff between real and nulls

* DONE Compare mathematica graph to dag to generated
* DONE Compare orig, rand, generated, book

* DONE get modularities back
* DONE calculate alpha
* DONE Fix directionality of generated graphs
* DONE pagerank beta w/ different parameter values

* DONE plot gen graph alpha surface
* DONE export full statistics for each theorem

Fix the createGraph (allow mult arrows)

* TODO Speed up modularity gen graph
** Memoize?
* DONE Create function to find max distance to axioms
* DONE graph -- remove depth consideration
** Namely fix the getDescendants function -- how to take the downclosure
** Copy code from max dist to axioms, and tweak the return fxn
* TODO plot using distribution from min to max depth for all paths

* TODO Explore use of modularity gen graph
* DONE Figure out how to increase modularity -- not currently working
   Only shift begin on arrow

* TODO Answer Simon emails

* TODO Write pieces of paper
