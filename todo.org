* TODO Decide if want to merge library and library proof folders

* DONE Separate out functionality for other kind of dag,
  Where should I put all of the other functions?
  The first kind of dag should be called dependency graphs
   Make two separate files
  Then can change names within ManipPfTrees.org to be more systematic

* DONE Factor out common functionality between ManipPfTrees.org and GenerateDependencyGraphs.org
  Want tree manip utilities, plot num nodes at depth

* TODO Create DAG for library
